Luke 3:21-22,"Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,
and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.”
"
"Mark 15,40-41","Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
He answered,
“So you say.”
The chief priests accused him of many things.
Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”
But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.
Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”
They cried out again, “Crucify him!”
Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”
But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”
Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.
The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.
They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.
When they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.
They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.
They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”
They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.
Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.
It was the third hour,
 and they crucified him.
The superscription of his accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”

Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”
 Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.
When the sixth hour
 had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted,
“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”

Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”
One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”
Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.
Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.
When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
"
Matthew 3:13-17,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?”
But Jesus, answering, said to him,
“Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.
Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.
Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
"
John 19:25-27,"But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother,
“Woman, behold, your son!”

Then he said to the disciple,
“Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.
"
Luke 8:26-39,"They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”
For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.
Jesus asked him,
“What is your name?”
He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.
Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.
The demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.
When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.
All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.
But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,

“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
"
John 1:29-34,"The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.’
I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.”
John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.
I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’
I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”
"
Luke 6:27-36,"
“But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,


bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.


To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also.


Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.

“As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.


If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.


If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.


If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.


But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.

“Therefore be merciful,
even as your Father is also merciful.
"
John 20:1-18,"Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have laid him!”
Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.
Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in.
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,
and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.
For as yet they didn’t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
They told her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”
She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”
When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.
Jesus said to her,
“Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?”
She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
Jesus said to her,
“Mary.”
She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!” which is to say, “Teacher!”
Jesus said to her,
“Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
"
Luke 11:1-4,"When he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”
He said to them,
“When you pray, say,
‘Our Father in heaven,
may your name be kept holy.
May your Kingdom come.
May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

Give us day by day our daily bread.

Forgive us our sins,
for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.

Bring us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.’”
"
John 2:14-21,"He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables.
To those who sold the doves, he said,
“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!”
His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”
The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?”
Jesus answered them,
“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?”
But he spoke of the temple of his body.
"
Matthew 13:1-9,"On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.
He spoke to them many things in parables, saying,
“Behold, a farmer went out to sow.


As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.


Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.


When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.


Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.


Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.


He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
"
Mark 1:9-11,"In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
"
Mark 1:12-13,"Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.
"
Matthew 4:1-11,"Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.
The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”
But he answered,
“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.’”
Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you.’ and,
‘On their hands they will bear you up,
so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus said to him,
“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’”
Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”
Then Jesus said to him,
“Get behind me,
Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”

Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.
"
Luke 8:11-15,"
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.


Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.


Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.


That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.


Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.
"
Matthew 17:1-8,"After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.
Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”
When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
Jesus came and touched them and said,
“Get up, and don’t be afraid.”

Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
"
Mark 5:1-20,"They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.
He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.
Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,
and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.”
For he said to him,
“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”

He asked him,
“What is your name?”
He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”
He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.
All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”
At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
The people came to see what it was that had happened.
They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.
Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
They began to beg him to depart from their region.
As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.
He didn’t allow him, but said to him,
“Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.”
He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.
"
Mark 11:15-18,"They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables, and the seats of those who sold the doves.
He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.
He taught, saying to them,
“Isn’t it written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?’
But you have made it a den of robbers!”
The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
"
Mark 5:21-43,"When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”
He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,
having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.
For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”
Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked,
“Who touched my clothes?”
His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”
He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
He said to her,
“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”
While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”
But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,
“Don’t be afraid, only believe.”
He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.
When he had entered in, he said to them,
“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”
They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
Taking the child by the hand, he said to her,
“Talitha cumi!”
 which means, being interpreted,
“Girl, I tell you, get up!”

Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.
He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.
"
Mark 4:13-20,"He said to them,
“Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?


The farmer sows the word.


The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.


These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.


They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.


Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,


and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.


Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”
"
Luke 4:1-13,"Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.
The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”
Jesus answered him, saying,
“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’”
The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.
If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.”
Jesus answered him,
“Get behind me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”
He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,
for it is written,
‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’
and,
‘On their hands they will bear you up,
lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus answering, said to him,
“It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”
When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.
"
John 6:1-15,"After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.
Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.
Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip,
“Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?”
This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little.”
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him,
“There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?”
Jesus said,
“Have the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
When they were filled, he said to his disciples,
“Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.”
So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.”
Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
"
Luke 9:28-36,"About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.
As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.
As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.
While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”
When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
"
Matthew 14:13-21,"Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”
But Jesus said to them,
“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”
He said,
“Bring them here to me.”
He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.
Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
"
Matthew 27:55-56,"Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
"
Matthew 10:1-4,"He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;
Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called Thaddaeus;
Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
"
Mark 16:1-8,"When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?”
for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.
He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!
But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”
They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.
"
Luke 19:45-46,"He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
saying to them,
“It is written, ‘My house is a house of prayer,’

but you have made it a ‘den of robbers’!”

Mark 4:1-9,"Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.
He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,

“Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,


and as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds
came and devoured it.


Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.


When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.


Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.


Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”
He said,
“Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”
"
Luke 2:1-7,"Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.
Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;
to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth.
She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
"
Luke 4:38-39,"He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.
He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
"
Matthew 6:7-15,"
In praying, don’t use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.


Therefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.


Pray like this: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.


Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.


Give us today our daily bread.


Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.


Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.’

“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.


But if you don’t forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
"
Matthew 13:18-23,"
“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.


When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.


What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;


yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.


What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.


What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”
"
Luke 6:12-16,"In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.
When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:
Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;
Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;
Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.
"
Luke 9:10-17,"The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.
He took them, and withdrew apart to a desert region of a city called Bethsaida.
But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing.
The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”
But he said to them,
“You give them something to eat.”
They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”
For they were about five thousand men.
He said to his disciples,
“Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”
They did so, and made them all sit down.
He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
"
Matthew 28:1-10,"Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”
They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,
“Rejoice!”
They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them,
“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers

that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”
"
Mark 3:13-19,"He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.
He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);
Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
Then he came into a house.
"
Luke 8:4-8,"When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.

“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.


Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.


Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.


Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit.” As he said these things, he called out,
“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”
"
Matthew 8:28-34,"When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,
 two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.
Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”
Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”
He said to them,
“Go!”
They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.
Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.
"
Matthew 5:43-48,"
“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor

and hate your enemy.’

But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,


that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.


For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?


If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors
do the same?


Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
"
Matthew 8:14-15,"When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him.

"
Mark 6:32-44,"They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.
Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.
When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.
Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”
But he answered them,
“You give them something to eat.”
They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”
He said to them,
“How many loaves do you have? Go see.”
When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”
He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.
They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.
They all ate, and were filled.
They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.
Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
"
Mark 9:2-8,"After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.
His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
Peter answered Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.
A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”
Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.
"
Luke 23:49,"All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
"
Matthew 21:12-13,"Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
He said to them,
“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’
but you have made it a den of robbers!”
"
Luke 24:1-12,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
They entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body.
While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”
They remembered his words,
returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.
These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them.
But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
"
Mark 1:29-31,"Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.
"
Luke 8:40-56,"When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.
A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,
came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.
Jesus said,
“Who touched me?”
When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say,
‘Who touched me?’”
But Jesus said,
“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”
When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
He said to her,
“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”
But Jesus hearing it, answered him,
“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”
When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.
All were weeping and mourning her, but he said,
“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”
They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.
But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying,
“Child, arise!”
Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
"
Matthew 1:18-25,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.
But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
She shall give birth to a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”
Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
and shall give birth to a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel”;
which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”
Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
"
Matthew 9:18-26,"While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;
for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”
But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said,
“Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.
When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
he said to them,
“Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.”
They were ridiculing him.
But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
The report of this went out into all that land.
