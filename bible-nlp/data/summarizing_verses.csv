verse,text
Matthew 5:1-7:29,"Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,

“Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

Blessed are the gentle,
for they shall inherit the earth.

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,

for they shall be filled.

Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.

Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they shall be called children of God.

Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake,

for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

“Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.


Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.


“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.


You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden.


Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.


Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill.


For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter
or one tiny pen stroke
shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.


Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.


For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

“You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’
and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’


But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause


will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’

will be in danger of the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.


“If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,


leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.


Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.


Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.

“You have heard that it was said,

‘You shall not commit adultery;’

but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.


If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.

If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.

“It was also said, ‘Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,’

but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.

“Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, ‘You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,’

but I tell you, don’t swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;


nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.


Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can’t make one hair white or black.


But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.

“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’

But I tell you, don’t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.


If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.


Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.


Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.

“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor

and hate your enemy.’

But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,


that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.


For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?


If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors
do the same?


Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

“Be careful that you don’t do your charitable giving before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.


Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don’t sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.


But when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does,


so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.

“When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.


But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.


In praying, don’t use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.


Therefore don’t be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.


Pray like this: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.


Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.


Give us today our daily bread.


Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.


Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.’

“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.


But if you don’t forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

“Moreover when you fast, don’t be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.


But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;


so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.


“Don’t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;


but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don’t break through and steal;


for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.


But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!


“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t serve both God and Mammon.


Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn’t life more than food, and the body more than clothing?


See the birds of the sky, that they don’t sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you of much more value than they?

“Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment
to his lifespan?


Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin,


yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.


But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith?

“Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’


For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.


But seek first God’s Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.


Therefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day’s own evil is sufficient.

“Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged.


For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.


Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?


Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye;’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye?


You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.

“Don’t give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.

“Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.


For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.


Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?


Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?


If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!


Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.

“Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.


How
narrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.

“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.


By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?


Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.


A good tree can’t produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.


Every tree that doesn’t grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.


Therefore by their fruits you will know them.


Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.


Many will tell me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?’


Then I will tell them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.’

“Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.


The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn’t fall, for it was founded on the rock.


Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn’t do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.


The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell—and great was its fall.”
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes.
"
John 13:1-17:26,"Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him,
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and was going to God,
arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”
Jesus answered him,
“You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.”
Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!”
Jesus answered him,
“If I don’t wash you, you have no part with me.”

Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”
Jesus said to him,
“Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.”

For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said,
“You are not all clean.”
So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them,
“Do you know what I have done to you?


You call me, ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord.’ You say so correctly, for so I am.


If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.


For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.


Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.


If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.


I don’t speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.’

From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.


Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”
When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified,
“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”
The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.
One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast.
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.”
He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast, asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
Jesus therefore answered,
“It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.” So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him.
Then Jesus said to him,
“What you do, do quickly.”
Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.
For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, “Buy what things we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.
Therefore having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
When he had gone out, Jesus said,
“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.


If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.


Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come,’ so now I tell you.


A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.


By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”
Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?”
Jesus answered,
“Where I am going, you can’t follow now, but you will follow afterwards.”
Peter said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
Jesus answered him,
“Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won’t crow until you have denied me three times.

“Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.


In my Father’s house are many homes. If it weren’t so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.


If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.


Where I go, you know, and you know the way.”
Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”
Jesus said to him,
“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.


If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him.”
Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”
Jesus said to him,
“Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father?’


Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.


Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake.


Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.


Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.


If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.


If you love me, keep my commandments.


I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor,

that he may be with you forever,—

the Spirit of truth, whom the world can’t receive; for it doesn’t see him, neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.


I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.


Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.


In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.


One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him.”
Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”
Jesus answered him,
“If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.


He who doesn’t love me doesn’t keep my words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the Father’s who sent me.


I have said these things to you, while still living with you.


But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.


Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don’t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.


You heard how I told you, ‘I go away, and I come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for the Father is greater than I.


Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.


I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.


But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.

“I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.


Every branch in me that doesn’t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.


You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.


Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.


I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.


If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.


If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.

“In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.


Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.


If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and remain in his love.


I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.

“This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.


Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.


You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.


No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.


You didn’t choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

“I command these things to you, that you may love one another.


If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.


If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.


Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’
If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.


But all these things will they do to you for my name’s sake, because they don’t know him who sent me.


If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.


He who hates me, hates my Father also.


If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.


But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’

“When the Counselor
has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.


You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.

“I have said these things to you so that you wouldn’t be caused to stumble.


They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.


They will do these things
because they have not known the Father, nor me.


But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.


But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’


But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.


Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.


When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;


about sin, because they don’t believe in me;


about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more;


about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.


“I have yet many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now.


However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming.


He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.


All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes
of mine, and will declare it to you.


A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.”
Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us,
‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’ and,
‘Because I go to the Father’?”
They said therefore, “What is this that he says,
‘A little while’? We don’t know what he is saying.”
Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them,
“Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’


Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.


A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.


Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.

“In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.


Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.


I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.


In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,


for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.


I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.”
His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech.
Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.”
Jesus answered them,
“Do you now believe?


Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.


I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”

Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said,
“Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;


even as you gave him authority over all flesh, so he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.


This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.


I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.


Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.


I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.


Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,


for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from you, and they have believed that you sent me.


I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.


All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.


I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.


While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.


But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.


I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.


I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.


They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.


Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.

As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.


For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.


Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who will believe in me through their word,


that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.


The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;


I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.


Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.


Righteous Father, the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.


I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.”
"
Luke 22:1-23:56,"Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.
He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.
They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.
The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,
“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”
They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”
He said to them,
“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.


Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’


He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”
They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.
He said to them,
“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,


for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”
He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said,
“Take this, and share it among yourselves,


for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”
He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying,
“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”
Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying,
“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.


But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.


The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”
They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
He said to them,
“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’


But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.


For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.


But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.


I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,


that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”
The Lord said,
“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat,


but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”
He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”
He said,
“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”
He said to them,
“When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?”
They said, “Nothing.”
Then he said to them,
“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.


For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’
For that which concerns me has an end.”
They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”
He said to them,
“That is enough.”
He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.
When he was at the place, he said to them,
“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”
He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
saying,
“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”
An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.
When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,
and said to them,
“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.
But Jesus said to him,
“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”
When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”
A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
But Jesus answered,
“Let me at least do this”—and he touched his ear, and healed him.
Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him,
“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?


When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”

They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.
When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.
A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.”
He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”
After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!”
But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”
After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!”
But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him,
“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”
He went out, and wept bitterly.
The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.
Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”
They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,
“If you are the Christ, tell us.”
But he said to them,
“If I tell you, you won’t believe,


and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.


From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?”
He said to them,
“You say it, because I am.”
They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”
The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.
They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”
Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
He answered him,
“So you say.”
Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”
But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.
Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.
He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.
The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.
Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.
Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.
Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—
one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”
He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.
Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.
He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.
When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.
A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.
But Jesus, turning to them, said,
“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.


For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’


Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’

For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”
There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.
When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
Jesus said,
“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”
Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.
The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”
The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”
But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”
He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”
Jesus said to him,
“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”
It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said,
“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.
When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”
All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.
All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man
(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom:
this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.
He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.
The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
"
Luke 15:11-32,"He said,
“A certain man had two sons.


The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of your property.’ He divided his livelihood between them.


Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.


When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.


He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.


He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.


But when he came to himself he said, ‘How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough to spare, and I’m dying with hunger!


I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.


I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’

“He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.


The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

“But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.


Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;


for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ They began to celebrate.

“Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.


He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.


He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.’


But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.


But he answered his father, ‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.


But when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’

“He said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.


But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’”
