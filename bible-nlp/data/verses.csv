0,Luke 1:5-25,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.
Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division,
according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.
For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.
He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”
Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”
The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.
Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”
The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.
When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,
“Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.”

1,Luke 1:26-38,"Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary.
Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!”
But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and give birth to a son, and will call his name ‘Jesus.’
He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,
and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”
Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”
The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.
Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
For nothing spoken by God is impossible.”
Mary said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.”
The angel departed from her.
",childhood,The Annunciation
2,Luke 1:39-56,"Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,
and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
She called out with a loud voice, and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!”
Mary said,
“My soul magnifies the Lord.
My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
for he has looked at the humble state of his servant.
For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
For he who is mighty has done great things for me.
Holy is his name.
His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him.
He has shown strength with his arm.
He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
He has put down princes from their thrones.
And has exalted the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things.
He has sent the rich away empty.
He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,
As he spoke to our fathers,
to Abraham and his offspring forever.”
Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house.
",childhood,Mary's Visit to Elizabeth
3,Luke 1:57-80,"Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son.
Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.
On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.”
They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”
They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.”
They all marveled.
His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.
Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.
All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.
His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
for he has visited and redeemed his people;
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),
salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
to show mercy towards our fathers,
to remember his holy covenant,
the oath which he swore to Abraham, our father,
to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,
should serve him without fear,
In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,
for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,
because of the tender mercy of our God,
whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

6,Matthew 1:18-25,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.
But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
She shall give birth to a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”
Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
and shall give birth to a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel”;
which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”
Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.

7,Luke 2:1-7,"Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.
Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;
to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth.
She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.

8,Matthew 2:1-12,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
“Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.”
When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born.
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,
‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
are in no way least among the princes of Judah:
for out of you shall come a governor,
who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”
Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.”
They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Being warned in a dream that they shouldn’t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.

9,Luke 2:8-20,"There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
For there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”
Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
“Glory to God in the highest,
on earth peace, good will toward men.”
When the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”
They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.

10,Luke 2:21-38,"When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord
(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”
Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,
then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
“Now you are releasing your servant, Master,
according to your word, in peace;
for my eyes have seen your salvation,
which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
a light for revelation to the nations,
and the glory of your people Israel.”
Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,
and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.
Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”
There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day.
Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.

He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,
and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men.
Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
“A voice was heard in Ramah,
lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children;
she wouldn’t be comforted,
because they are no more.”
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.”
He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it,
but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.
After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.
All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”
He said to them,
“Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”
They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them.
And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

34,Matthew 4:1-11,"Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.
The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”
But he answered,
“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.’”
Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you.’ and,
‘On their hands they will bear you up,
so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus said to him,
“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’”
Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”
Then Jesus said to him,
“Get behind me,
Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”

The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”
Jesus answered him, saying,
“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’”
The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.
If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.”
Jesus answered him,
“Get behind me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”
He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,
for it is written,
‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’
and,
‘On their hands they will bear you up,

37,John 1:35-51,"Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,
and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”
The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them,
“What are you looking for?”
They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?”
He said to them,
“Come, and see.”
They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said,
“You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter).
On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him,
“Follow me.”
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”
Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,
“Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!”
Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?”
Jesus answered him,
“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”
Jesus answered him,
“Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”
He said to him,
“Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

38,John 2:1-11,"The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there.
Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.
When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”
Jesus said to her,
“Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.”
His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.”
Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.
Jesus said to them,
“Fill the water pots with water.” They filled them up to the brim.
He said to them,
“Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.” So they took it.
When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!”

To those who sold the doves, he said,
“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!”
His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”
The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?”
Jesus answered them,
“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?”
But he spoke of the temple of his body.

The same came to him by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”
Jesus answered him,
“Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew,

he can’t see God’s Kingdom.”
Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?”
Jesus answered,
“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom.

That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.


Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’


The wind
blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”
Nicodemus answered him, “How can these things be?”
Jesus answered him,
“Are you the teacher of Israel, and don’t understand these things?


Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness.


If I told you earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?


No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.


As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,


that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.


For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.


For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.


He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.


This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.


For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.


But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.”

They came to John, and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.”
John answered, “A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.
You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’
He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.

What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.
He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.

50,John 4:4-42,"He needed to pass through Samaria.
So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.
Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her,
“Give me a drink.”
For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
Jesus answered her,
“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?
Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?”
Jesus answered her,
“Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,


but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”
The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.”
Jesus said to her,
“Go, call your husband, and come here.”

The woman answered, “I have no husband.”
Jesus said to her,
“You said well, ‘I have no husband,’


for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.”
The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”
Jesus said to her,
“Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.


You worship that which you don’t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.


But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.


God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”
The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When he has come, he will declare to us all things.”
Jesus said to her,
“I am he, the one who speaks to you.”
At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?”
So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,
“Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?”
They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
But he said to them,
“I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”
The disciples therefore said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”
Jesus said to them,
“My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.

From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I did.”
So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.
Many more believed because of his word.
They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.”

He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,
“Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”
Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”
When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.
They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”
For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;

Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Jesus.

The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”
He said to them,
“Go!”
They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.
Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.

114,Mark 5:1-20,"They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.
He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.
Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,
and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.”
For he said to him,
“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”

He asked him,
“What is your name?”
He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”
He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.
All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”
At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
The people came to see what it was that had happened.
They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.
Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
They began to beg him to depart from their region.
As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.
He didn’t allow him, but said to him,
“Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.”
He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.

115,Luke 8:26-39,"They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”
For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.
Jesus asked him,
“What is your name?”
He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.
Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.
The demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.
When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.
All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.
But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,

“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.

116,Matthew 9:18-26,"While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;
for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”
But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said,
“Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.
When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
he said to them,
“Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.”
They were ridiculing him.
But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
The report of this went out into all that land.

117,Mark 5:21-43,"When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”
He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,
having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.
For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”
Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked,
“Who touched my clothes?”
His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”
He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
He said to her,
“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”
While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”
But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,
“Don’t be afraid, only believe.”
He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.
When he had entered in, he said to them,
“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”
They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
Taking the child by the hand, he said to her,
“Talitha cumi!”
 which means, being interpreted,
“Girl, I tell you, get up!”

Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.
He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.

118,Luke 8:40-56,"When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.
A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,
came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.
Jesus said,
“Who touched me?”
When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say,
‘Who touched me?’”
But Jesus said,
“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”
When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
He said to her,
“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”
But Jesus hearing it, answered him,
“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”
When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.
All were weeping and mourning her, but he said,
“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”
They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.
But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying,
“Child, arise!”
Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.

They told him, “Yes, Lord.”
Then he touched their eyes, saying,

“Call him.”
They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!”

157,Luke 7:18-23,"The disciples of John told him about all these things.
John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?”
When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’”
In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.
Jesus answered them,
“Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.


Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”
",ministry-in-galilee,John the Baptist's Question and Jesus' Answer
158,Matthew 11:7-19,"As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John,
“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?


But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.


But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.


For this is he, of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’

Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.


From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.

For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.


If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.


He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions


and say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’


For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’

159,Luke 7:24-35,"When John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John,
“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?


But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.


But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.


This is he of whom it is written,
‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way before you.’

“For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.”
When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.
But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.


“To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?


They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’

Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

He said to him,
“You have judged correctly.”

You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.


You didn’t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.

Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,

What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.


What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”
",ministry-in-galilee,Interpretation of the Parable of the Sower
202,Mark 4:13-20,"He said to them,
“Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?


The farmer sows the word.


The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.


These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.


They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.


Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,


and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.


Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”
",ministry-in-galilee,Interpretation of the Parable of the Sower
203,Luke 8:11-15,"
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.


Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.


Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.


That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.


Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.

But when the blade sprang up and produced fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.


The servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?’

“He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’
“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’


“But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.

223,John 5:1,"After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
",ministry-in-galilee,Second Journey (to Jerusalem)
224,John 5:2-47,"Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda”, having five porches.
In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;
for an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.
A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him,
“Do you want to be made well?”
The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”
Jesus said to him,
“Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”
Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.
Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
So the Jews said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”
He answered them, “He who made me well, the same said to me,
‘Take up your mat, and walk.’”
Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you,
‘Take up your mat, and walk’?”
But he who was healed didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,
“Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”

The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
But Jesus answered them,
“My Father is still working, so I am working, too.”
For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
Jesus therefore answered them,
“Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.


For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.


For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.


For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,


that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.

“Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.


Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear will live.


For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.


He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.


Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,


and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.


I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.

“If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.


It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.


You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.


But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.


He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.


But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.


The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.


You don’t have his word living in you; because you don’t believe him whom he sent.

“You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.


Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.


I don’t receive glory from men.


But I know you, that you don’t have God’s love in yourselves.


I have come in my Father’s name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.


How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the glory that comes from the only God?

“Don’t think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.


For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.


But if you don’t believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”

However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”

244,John 6:26-59,"Jesus answered them,
“Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.


Don’t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”
They said therefore to him, “What must we do, that we may work the works of God?”
Jesus answered them,
“This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”
They said therefore to him, “What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.’”
Jesus therefore said to them,
“Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.


For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.”
They said therefore to him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”
Jesus said to them,
“I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.


But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don’t believe.


All those whom the Father gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.


For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.


This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.


This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”
The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,
“I am the bread which came down out of heaven.”
They said, “Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say,
‘I have come down out of heaven?’”

Therefore Jesus answered them,
“Don’t murmur among yourselves.


No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.


It is written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’


Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.


Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.


Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.


I am the bread of life.


Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.


This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.


I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”
The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
Jesus therefore said to them,
“Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have life in yourselves.


He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.


For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.


He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.


As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.


This is the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”
He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

245,Matthew 15:1-20,"Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”
He answered them,
“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?


For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’
and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’

But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”


he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.


You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,

‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,
and honor me with their lips;
but their heart is far from me.

And in vain do they worship me,
teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”
He summoned the multitude, and said to them,
“Hear, and understand.


That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”
Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?”
But he answered,
“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.


Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”
So Jesus said,
“Do you also still not understand?


Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?


But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.


For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.


These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”
",ministry-in-galilee,What Defiles a Person - Traditional and Real
246,Mark 7:1-23,"Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.
Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.
(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.
They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)
The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”
He answered them,
“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,
‘This people honors me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me.

But they worship me in vain,
teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’

“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”
He said to them,
“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.


For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’
and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’

But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,
 that is to say, given to God”;’


then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,


making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”
He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them,
“Hear me, all of you, and understand.


There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.


If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”
When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.
He said to them,
“Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,


because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”

He said,
“That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.


For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,


covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.


All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”

Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”
But he answered her not a word.
His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”
But he answered,
“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
But he answered,
“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”
But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”

For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.
But Jesus said to her,
“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”

He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;

335,Matthew 17:1-9,"After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.
Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”
When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
Jesus came and touched them and said,
“Get up, and don’t be afraid.”

Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying,
“Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”

His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
Peter answered Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.
A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”
Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.
As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.

337,Luke 9:28-36,"About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.
As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.
As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.
While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”
When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.

“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.”
Jesus answered,
“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”
Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?”
He said to them,
“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.


But this kind doesn’t go out except by prayer and fasting.”

341,Mark 9:14-29,"Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.
Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him.
He asked the scribes,
“What are you asking them?”
One of the multitude answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;
and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t able.”
He answered him,
“Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.”
They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.
He asked his father,
“How long has it been since this has come to him?”
He said, “From childhood.
Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.”
Jesus said to him,
“If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.”
Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”
When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him,
“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!”
After crying out and convulsing him greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, “He is dead.”
But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”
He said to them,
“This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.”

Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.
I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”
Jesus answered,
“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”
While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

Peter said to him, “From strangers.”
Jesus said to him,
“Therefore the children are exempt.

Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.


When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.

But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.


The servant therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’


The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.

“But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii,
and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’

“So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’


He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.


So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told their lord all that was done.


Then his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.


Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’


His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.

379,Mark 12:28-34,"One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”
Jesus answered,
“The greatest is, ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:


you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’
This is the first commandment.


The second is like this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
There is no other commandment greater than these.”
The scribe said to him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,
and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

“A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.


By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.


In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.


But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,


came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.


On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’


Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”

“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?


For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’

Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.
(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.
They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)
The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”
He answered them,
“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,
‘This people honors me with their lips,

The Lord said to him,
“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.


You foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?


But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.


But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s love. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.


Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.


Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”
One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”
He said,
“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.


Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.


So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.


Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,


that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;


from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.

“What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?


If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.

421,Luke 15:1-7,"Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him.
The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, “This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.”
He told them this parable.

“Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?


When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.


When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’


I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.

“A certain man had two sons.


The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of your property.’ He divided his livelihood between them.


Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.


When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.


He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.


He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.


But when he came to himself he said, ‘How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough to spare, and I’m dying with hunger!


I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.


I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’

“He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.


The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

“But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.


Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;


for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ They began to celebrate.

“Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.


He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.


He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.’


But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.


But he answered his father, ‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.


But when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’

“He said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.


But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’”

“There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.


He called him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’


“The manager said within himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.


I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.’


Calling each one of his lord’s debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my lord?’


He said, ‘A hundred batos of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’


Then he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred cors of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’

“His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.

They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”

I know that you are Abraham’s offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.


I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.”
They answered him, “Our father is Abraham.”
Jesus said to them,
“If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.


But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn’t do this.


You do the works of your father.”
They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God.”
Therefore Jesus said to them,
“If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but he sent me.


Why don’t you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word.


You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.


But because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me.


Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?


He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.”

462,John 8:48-59,"Then the Jews answered him, “Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?”
Jesus answered,
“I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.


But I don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.


Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.”
Then the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say,
‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’
Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”
Jesus answered,
“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.


You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.


Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.”
The Jews therefore said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”
Jesus said to them,
“Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.”
Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.

463,John 9:1-41,"As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
Jesus answered,
“Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.


I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.


While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,
and said to him,
“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”
Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”
He said, “I am he.”
They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”
He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me,
‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”
Then they asked him, “Where is he?”
He said, “I don’t know.”
They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them.
Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”
He said, “He is a prophet.”
The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”
His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”
So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”
He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”
They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”
They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”
The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.
Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” They threw him out.
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said,
“Do you believe in the Son of God?”
He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”
Jesus said to him,
“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”
He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.
Jesus said,
“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”
Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”
Jesus said to them,
“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.

464,John 10:1-18,"
“Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn’t enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.


But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.


The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.


Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.


They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don’t know the voice of strangers.”
Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn’t understand what he was telling them.
Jesus therefore said to them again,
“Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep’s door.


All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.


I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.


The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.


I am the good shepherd.
The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.


He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.


The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn’t care for the sheep.


I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own;


even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.


I have other sheep, which are not of this fold.
I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.


Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,

that I may take it again.


No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.”

“Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,

and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?’

So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.”
They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?”
He said to them,
“Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.


I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.”
His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.”
But he said to them,
“Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.


For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.”

“For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.


But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.

For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,


and the two will become one flesh,

He went out about the third hour,
and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.


He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went their way.


Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,

he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, ‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’


“They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’
“He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’


When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’

“When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.


When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius.


When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,


saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’

Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.

But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.

It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.
The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, “Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.”
But when Jesus heard it, he said,
“This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.”
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.
Then after this he said to the disciples,
“Let’s go into Judea again.”
The disciples told him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?”
Jesus answered,
“Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.


But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn’t in him.”
He said these things, and after that, he said to them,
“Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.”
The disciples therefore said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
So Jesus said to them plainly then,
“Lazarus is dead.


I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let’s go to him.”
Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let’s go also, that we may die with him.”
So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.
Therefore Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.
Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.”
Jesus said to her,
“Your brother will rise again.”
Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
Jesus said to her,
“I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.


Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
She said to him, “Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God’s Son, he who comes into the world.”
When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, “The Teacher is here, and is calling you.”
When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.
Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”
Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
and said,
“Where have you laid him?”
They told him, “Lord, come and see.”
Jesus wept.
The Jews therefore said, “See how much affection he had for him!”
Some of them said, “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?”
Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
Jesus said,
“Take away the stone.”
Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”
Jesus said to her,
“Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you would see God’s glory?”
So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said,
“Father, I thank you that you listened to me.


I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude standing around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.”

When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice,
“Lazarus, come out!”
He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.

“Free him, and let him go.”

If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.”
Now he didn’t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,

When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him,
“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”

He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully.
When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.”

In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two.


But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.

“Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.


He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.’

I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’

“But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter.


You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.

He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins,

and told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’


But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’

“When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.


The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’

“He said to him, ‘Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’


“The second came, saying, ‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’


“So he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’


Another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,


for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’

“He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that which I didn’t sow.


Then why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’


He said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.’

“They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’


‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.

All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
“Tell the daughter of Zion,

There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.
The second took her as wife, and he died childless.
The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
Afterward the woman also died.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.”
Jesus said to them,
“The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.


But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.


For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.

But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries

broad, enlarge the fringes
of their garments,


and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,


the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ by men.


But don’t you be called ‘Rabbi,’ for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers.

Every branch in me that doesn’t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.


You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.


Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.


I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.


If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.


If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.

Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.

You didn’t choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.


Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’
If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.


But all these things will they do to you for my name’s sake, because they don’t know him who sent me.


If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.


He who hates me, hates my Father also.


If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.

When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;

This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.


I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.


Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.


I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.


Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,

All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.


I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.


While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.


But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.


I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.


I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.


They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.


Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.

As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.


For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.


Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who will believe in me through their word,

He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying,

He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,
“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour?


Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying,
“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.”

He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.

The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”
They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in.
Therefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day.
Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
“They took the thirty pieces of silver,
the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
whom some of the children of Israel priced,
and they gave them for the potter’s field,
as the Lord commanded me.”

637,Matthew 27:11-14,"Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
Jesus said to him,
“So you say.”
When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”
He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
",passion,The Trial before Pilate
638,Mark 15:2-5,"Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
He answered,
“So you say.”
The chief priests accused him of many things.
Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”
But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
",passion,The Trial before Pilate
639,Luke 23:2-5,"They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”
Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
He answered him,
“So you say.”
Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”
",passion,The Trial before Pilate
640,John 18:29-38,"Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”
They answered him, “If this man weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”
Pilate therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”
Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,”
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
Jesus answered him,
“Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?”
Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?”
Jesus answered,
“My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn’t be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.”
Pilate therefore said to him, “Are you a king then?”
Jesus answered,
“You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.”
Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”
When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, “I find no basis for a charge against him.
",passion,The Trial before Pilate
641,Luke 23:6-12,"But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.
Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.
He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.
The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.
Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.
",passion,Jesus before Herod
642,Luke 23:13-16,"Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.
Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
",passion,Pilate Declares Jesus Innocent
643,Matthew 27:15-23,"Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.
They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?”
For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”
Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”
They said, “Barabbas!”
Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”
They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”
But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?”
But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”
",passion,Jesus or Barabbas?
644,Mark 15:6-14,"Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.
Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”
They cried out again, “Crucify him!”
Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”
But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”
",passion,Jesus or Barabbas?
645,Luke 23:17-23,"Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—
one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”
He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.
",passion,Jesus or Barabbas?
646,John 18:39-40,"But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
Then they all shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
",passion,Jesus or Barabbas?
647,Matthew 27:28-31,"They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.
They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.

648,Mark 15:17-20,"They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”

When they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.
",passion,“Behold the Man!”
649,John 19:1-15,"So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him.
The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
They kept saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they kept slapping him.
Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”
Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, “Behold, the man!”
When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!”
Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.”
The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.”
When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.
He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.
Pilate therefore said to him, “Aren’t you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”
Jesus answered,
“You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.”
At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!”
When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement”, but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”
Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”
They cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”
Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”
The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”

659,Luke 23:26-32,"When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.
A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.
But Jesus, turning to them, said,
“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.


For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’


Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’

they gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,
and they sat and watched him there.
They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”

662,Mark 15:22-26,"They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”

663,Luke 23:33-34,"When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.

where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘he said, “I am King of the Jews.”’”
Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
Then they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,
“They parted my garments among them.
For my cloak they cast lots.”
Therefore the soldiers did these things.
But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother,
“Woman, behold, your son!”

Then he said to the disciple,
“Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.

Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.
The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”
Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;

Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;
but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his legs.
However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.

When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.

Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.
So they took Jesus’ body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.

Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”

His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.

for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.
He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!
But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”
They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.
",resurrection,The Women at the Tomb
687,Luke 24:1-12,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
They entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body.
While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”
They remembered his words,
returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.
These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them.
But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
",resurrection,The Women at the Tomb
688,John 20:1-13,"Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have laid him!”
Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.
Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in.
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,
and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.
For as yet they didn’t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
They told her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”
She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”
",resurrection,The Women at the Tomb
689,Matthew 28:9-10,"As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,
“Rejoice!”
They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them,
“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers

that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”

690,Mark 16:9-11,"
Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to the Women
691,Luke 24:10-11,"Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.
These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them.
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to the Women
692,John 20:14-18,"When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.
Jesus said to her,
“Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?”
She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
Jesus said to her,
“Mary.”
She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!” which is to say, “Teacher!”
Jesus said to her,
“Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to the Women
693,Matthew 28:11-15,"Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.
When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”
So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today.
",resurrection,The Report of the Guard
694,Mark 16:12-13,"After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.
They went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to Two on the Way to Emmaus
695,Luke 24:13-35,"Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.
While they talked and questioned together, Jesus himself came near, and went with them.
But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
He said to them,
“What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?”
One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?”
He said to them,
“What things?”
They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;
and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”
He said to them,
“Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!


Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”
Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
They came near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.
They urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.”
He went in to stay with them.
When he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them.
Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.
They said to one another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?”
They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!”
They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to Two on the Way to Emmaus
696,Luke 24:36-43,"As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them,
“Peace be to you.”
But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
He said to them,
“Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?


See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
While they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them,
“Do you have anything here to eat?”
They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
He took them, and ate in front of them.

697,John 20:19-23,"When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle, and said to them,
“Peace be to you.”
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.
Jesus therefore said to them again,
“Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.”
When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them,
“Receive the Holy Spirit!


If you forgive anyone’s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s sins, they have been retained.”
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to His Disciples (Thomas being Absent)
698,John 20:24-29,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn’t with them when Jesus came.
The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord!”
But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the middle, and said,
“Peace be to you.”
Then he said to Thomas,
“Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don’t be unbelieving, but believing.”
Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”
Jesus said to him,
“Because you have seen me,
you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.”
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to His Disciples (Thomas being Present)
699,Mark 16:14-18,"Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
He said to them,
“Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.


He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.


These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;


they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to the Eleven While They Sit at Table
700,Matthew 28:16-20,"But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying,
“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.


Go
and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,


teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.
",resurrection,Jesus Appears to the Eleven on a Mountain in Galilee
701,John 21:1-14,"After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.
Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going fishing.”
They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.
But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus.
Jesus therefore said to them,
“Children, have you anything to eat?”

They answered him, “No.”
He said to them,
“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”
They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.
That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”
So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.
But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.
So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
Jesus said to them,
“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.
Jesus said to them,
“Come and eat breakfast.”
None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing that it was the Lord.
Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
