Matthew 2:1-12,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
“Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.”
When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born.
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,
‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
are in no way least among the princes of Judah:
for out of you shall come a governor,
who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”
Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.”
They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Being warned in a dream that they shouldn’t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.

Matthew 3:13-17,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?”
But Jesus, answering, said to him,
“Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.
Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.
Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”

Matthew 4:1-11,"Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.
The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”
But he answered,
“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.’”
Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you.’ and,
‘On their hands they will bear you up,
so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus said to him,
“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’”
Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”
Then Jesus said to him,
“Get behind me,
Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”

Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.

Matthew 5:20-48,"
For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

“You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’
and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’


But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause


will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’

will be in danger of the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.


“If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,


leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.


Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.


Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.

“You have heard that it was said,

‘You shall not commit adultery;’

but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.


If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.

If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.

“It was also said, ‘Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,’

but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.

“Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, ‘You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,’

but I tell you, don’t swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;


nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.


Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can’t make one hair white or black.


But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.

“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’

But I tell you, don’t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.


If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.


Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.


Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.

“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor

and hate your enemy.’

But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,


that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.


For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?


If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors
do the same?


Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

Matthew 8:14-17,"When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him.

When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”
",2
Matthew 9:18-26,"While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;
for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”
But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said,
“Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.
When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
he said to them,
“Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.”
They were ridiculing him.
But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
The report of this went out into all that land.

Matthew 10:37-39,"
He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn’t worthy of me.


He who doesn’t take his cross and follow after me, isn’t worthy of me.


He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.

Matthew 13:1-9,"On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.
He spoke to them many things in parables, saying,
“Behold, a farmer went out to sow.


As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.


Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.


When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.


Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.


Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.


He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
",1
Matthew 13:18-23,"
“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.


When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.


What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;


yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.


What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.


What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”
",1
Matthew 14:22-33,"Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.
But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear.
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying,
“Cheer up! It is I!

Don’t be afraid.”
Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.”
He said,
“Come!”
Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.
But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”
Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him,
“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”
When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the Son of God!”
",2
Matthew 15:1-20,"Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”
He answered them,
“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?


For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’
and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’

But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”


he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.


You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,

‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,
and honor me with their lips;
but their heart is far from me.

And in vain do they worship me,
teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”
He summoned the multitude, and said to them,
“Hear, and understand.


That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”
Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?”
But he answered,
“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.


Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”
So Jesus said,
“Do you also still not understand?


Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?


But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.


For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.


These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”

"Matthew 17,1-8","After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.
Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”
When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
Jesus came and touched them and said,
“Get up, and don’t be afraid.”

Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying,
“Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
Jesus answered them,
“Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,


but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.”
Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.
When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, and saying,
“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.”
Jesus answered,
“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”
Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?”
He said to them,
“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.


But this kind doesn’t go out except by prayer and fasting.”

While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them,
“The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,


and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.”

They were exceedingly sorry.
When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?”
He said, “Yes.”
When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying,
“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”
Peter said to him, “From strangers.”
Jesus said to him,
“Therefore the children are exempt.


But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin.
Take that, and give it to them for me and you.”
After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.
Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”
When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
Jesus came and touched them and said,
“Get up, and don’t be afraid.”

Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.

Matthew 18:1-5,"In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?”
Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the middle of them,
and said,
“Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.


Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.


Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,

",3
Matthew 18:21-35,"Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?”
Jesus said to him,
“I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.


Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.


When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.

But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.


The servant therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’


The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.

“But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii,
and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’

“So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’


He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.


So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told their lord all that was done.


Then his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.


Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’


His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.


So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.”

Matthew 26:26-29,"As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said,
“Take, eat; this is my body.”
He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying,
“All of you drink it,


for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.


But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”

Matthew 27:45-54,"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
“Eli, Eli, lima
sabachthani?”
 That is,
“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.
The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”
Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.”

Matthew 28:1-10,"Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”
They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,
“Rejoice!”
They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them,
“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers

that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”

Mark 1:9-11,"In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”

Mark 1:21-28,"They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”
Jesus rebuked him, saying,
“Be quiet, and come out of him!”

The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”
The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.

"Mark 1,29-31","The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the prophets,
“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way before you:
the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
‘Make ready the way of the Lord!
Make his paths straight!’”
John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.
John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.
I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”
In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.
Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom,
and saying,
“The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”
Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them,
“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”
Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”
Jesus rebuked him, saying,
“Be quiet, and come out of him!”

The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”
The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.
Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.
At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons.
All the city was gathered together at the door.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.
Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.
Simon and those who were with him followed after him;
and they found him, and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”
He said to them,
“Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”
He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”
Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him,
“I want to. Be made clean.”
When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,
and said to him,
“See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”
But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.
Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.

Mark 4:1-9,"Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.
He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,

“Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,


and as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds
came and devoured it.


Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.


When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.


Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.


Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”
He said,
“Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”

Mark 4:35-41,"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them,
“Let’s go over to the other side.”
Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.
A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.
He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”
He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,
“Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
He said to them,
“Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”
They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
",2
Mark 5:21-43,"When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”
He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,
having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.
For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”
Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked,
“Who touched my clothes?”
His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”
He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
He said to her,
“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”
While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”
But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,
“Don’t be afraid, only believe.”
He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.
When he had entered in, he said to them,
“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”
They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
Taking the child by the hand, he said to her,
“Talitha cumi!”
 which means, being interpreted,
“Girl, I tell you, get up!”

Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.
He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.

Mark 6:30-44,"The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.
He said to them,
“You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile.” For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.
Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.
When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.
Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”
But he answered them,
“You give them something to eat.”
They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”
He said to them,
“How many loaves do you have? Go see.”
When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”
He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.
They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.
They all ate, and were filled.
They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.
Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.

Mark 9:2-8,"After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.
His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
Peter answered Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.
A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”
Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.

Mark 9:33-37,"He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them,
“What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?”
But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.
He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them,
“If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.”
He took a little child, and set him in the middle of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,

“Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn’t receive me, but him who sent me.”

Mark 16:1-8,"When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?”
for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.
He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!
But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”
They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.

Luke 2:1-20,"Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.
Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;
to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth.
She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
For there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”
Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
“Glory to God in the highest,
on earth peace, good will toward men.”
When the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”
They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.

Luke 3:21-22,"Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,

Luke 4:1-13,"Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.
The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”
Jesus answered him, saying,
“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’”
The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.
If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.”
Jesus answered him,
“Get behind me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”
He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,
for it is written,
‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’
and,
‘On their hands they will bear you up,
lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus answering, said to him,
“It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”
When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.

Luke 4:38-41,"He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.
He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
Demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.

Luke 5:1-11,"Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,
“Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”
Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”
When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.
They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”
For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;
and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
Jesus said to Simon,
“Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”
When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.

Luke 6:27-36,"
“But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,


bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.


To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also.


Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.

“As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.


If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.


If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.


If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.


But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.

“Therefore be merciful,
even as your Father is also merciful.

Luke 8:4-15,"When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.

“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.


Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.


Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.


Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit.” As he said these things, he called out,
“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”
Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”
He said,
“To you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’

Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.


Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.


Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.


That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.


Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.

Luke 8:22-25,"Now on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them,
“Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.
But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.
They came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.
He said to them,
“Where is your faith?” Being afraid they marveled, saying to one another, “Who is this then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”

Luke 8:40-56,"When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.
A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,
came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.
Jesus said,
“Who touched me?”
When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say,
‘Who touched me?’”
But Jesus said,
“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”
When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
He said to her,
“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”
But Jesus hearing it, answered him,
“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”
When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.
All were weeping and mourning her, but he said,
“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”
They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.
But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying,
“Child, arise!”
Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.

Luke 9:10-17,"The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.
He took them, and withdrew apart to a desert region of a city called Bethsaida.
But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing.
The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”
But he said to them,
“You give them something to eat.”
They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”
For they were about five thousand men.
He said to his disciples,
“Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”
They did so, and made them all sit down.
He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.

Luke 9:28-36,"About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.
As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.
As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.
While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”
When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.

Luke 10:25-37,"Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”

“What is written in the law? How do you read it?”

He answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.”
He said to him,
“You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”
But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”
Jesus answered,
“A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.


By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.


In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.


But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,


came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.


On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’


Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”
He said, “He who showed mercy on him.”
Then Jesus said to him,
“Go and do likewise.”

He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said,
“Take this, and share it among yourselves,


for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”
He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying,
“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”
Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying,
“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.

Luke 23:44-49,"It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said,
“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.
When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”

All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.

Luke 24:1-12,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
They entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body.
While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”
They remembered his words,
returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.
These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them.
But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.

John 1:1-18,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made.
In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome
 it.
There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.
He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.
The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.
He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him.
But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name:
who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’”
From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.
For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.
No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.

I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.”
John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.
I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’

John 2:1-11,"The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there.
Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.
When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”
Jesus said to her,
“Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.”
His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.”
Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.
Jesus said to them,
“Fill the water pots with water.” They filled them up to the brim.
He said to them,
“Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.” So they took it.
When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!”
This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

John 3:1-21,"Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
The same came to him by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”
Jesus answered him,
“Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew,

he can’t see God’s Kingdom.”
Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?”
Jesus answered,
“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom.

That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.


Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’


The wind
blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”
Nicodemus answered him, “How can these things be?”
Jesus answered him,
“Are you the teacher of Israel, and don’t understand these things?


Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness.


If I told you earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?


No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.


As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,


that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.


For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.


For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.


He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.


This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.


For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.


But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.”

John 19:16-30,"So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.
He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called “The Place of a Skull”, which is called in Hebrew, “Golgotha”,
where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘he said, “I am King of the Jews.”’”
Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
Then they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,
“They parted my garments among them.
For my cloak they cast lots.”
Therefore the soldiers did these things.
But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother,
“Woman, behold, your son!”

Then he said to the disciple,
“Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.
After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said,
“I am thirsty.”
Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,
“It is finished.” He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.

John 20:1-18,"Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have laid him!”
Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.
Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in.
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,
and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.
For as yet they didn’t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
They told her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”
She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”
When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.
Jesus said to her,
“Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?”
She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
Jesus said to her,
“Mary.”
She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!” which is to say, “Teacher!”
Jesus said to her,
“Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
